    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Spherical cap harmonic analysis (SCHA) was developed by Haines (1985) to model the field over a small portion of the globe. The basis functions of SHA and SCHA consist of associated Legendre functions in colatitude, trigonometric functions in longitude, and powers of radial distance (Haines, 1988). The difference is the associated Legendre functions of SHA have integral degrees, while for SCHA they have non-integral degrees. SCHA’s domain of interest is shown in following figure, and is defined by the half-angle of the spherical cap $\\theta_0$  and the radial distances between $r = a$ and $r = b$.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>While the spherical harmonic functions of the SHA are orthogonal over the entire globe, they are orthogonal over the cap in SCHA. In SCHA, the boundary conditions must be applied to the edge of the cap in order to solve Laplace’s equation for the scalar magnetic potential. The boundary conditions require the continuity of the potential in longitude, regularity at the spherical cap pole, and both the potential and its derivative with respect to the colatitude at the cap boundary (Torta, 2019). In the SCHA model, the scalar magnetic potential $U$ at $\\theta_0$ or at the edge of the spherical cap and its derivative in accordance with $\\theta$ must be arbitrary</p>\n",

The longitude and colatitude, $(θ_T,φ_T)$, in these boundary conditions and the SCHA calculations are in the spherical cap reference frame. As a result, it is essential to transform the site locations and the magnetic field components into this spherical cap reference frame.</p>\n",

    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>This is similar to the SHA form; the difference is that now the associated Legendre polynomials are real and integral order ($m$) but not necessarily of integral degree ($n_k(m)$). The Gauss coefficients no longer describe a best fit to the geocentric dipole, quadrupole, and so on as in SHA, although they still form the basis of the model field. The coefficients are determined using the same methodology as SHA. The spatial truncation index ($k$) and order ($m$) in SCHA describe the sectioning over the spherical cap. This division defines the resolution of the features that can be mapped using SCHA (Fiori, 2020).</p>\n",

This is because a high degree expansion is needed in order to include large wavelengths over a small-cap, and can cause a problem if not enough data are available is (Verbanac, 2007). As a rule, the cap region must be at least coincident with the spatial content of the features of the field being represented (Torta, 2019). This problem has been solved by Torta et al. (1992) by increasing the cap half-angle to extend the wavelength content of the basis functions artificially.
